That's my professional intro up there. But this is my personal website, and while it has some information about my career, it's mostly a home for my personal projects and ideas. For the past few years I've been enjoying hobbies and projects that take place in the physical world (playing music, cooking for others) and have not been keeping much of an online presence.

I currently work for [Hex](www.hex.tech), building collaborative data tools. If you want to speak to me about my professional work or view my portfolio, you can [contact me here](mailto:lkpttn@gmail.com). Otherwise, it probably won't be too long before a new fascination draws me in and fills the space below.
