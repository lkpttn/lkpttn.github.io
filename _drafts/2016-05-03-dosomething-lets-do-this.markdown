The DoSomething app turns information into action. Designed to let DoSomething users take immediate action on the news they read everyday, the app features a news feed to bring the biggest issues from a variety of issues directly to a user. From there, they could be connected to immediate, impactful ways to make a difference.

> Whatever the news and whatever your cause, weâ€™ve got over 270 campaigns so you can make the world suck less.

The DoSomething app provided a notable list of firsts for the organization. We transitioned our user database out of a legacy service and began taking steps to a micro-service architecture that allowed us to access user and campaign information outside of our main web platform. It was also our first excursion into native development for mobile platforms, and later agnostic frameworks like React Native.

At the beginning of the project I was just the user experience designer, but over the course of development I became the lead designer and eventually project lead to oversee the entire process, including major pivots and launch.
