Hello. I'm a designer, programmer and computer enthusiast. I create humane intersections of systems and people, building tools that empower teams and features that put users first.

Previously I worked as a Senior Product Designer and Design Systems Lead at [Propel](https://www.joinpropel.com/), creating financial services for low-income Amercians. At [DoSomething.org](https://www.dosomething.org/us/about) I created features and tools that helped millions of young people make an impact in their communities. I have side interests in generative art and [barbequing for great causes](https://www.tikkunbbq.com/).

I'm currently looking for new opportunities as a senior/staff individual contributor or as a design systems/operations manager. You can view my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lkpttn/), my [resume](/assets/LukePattonResume.pdf), or send me an [email](mailto:lkpttn@gmail.com?subject=Howdy) to get connected.
