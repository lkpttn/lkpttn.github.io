[Canvas Cards](https://canvas-cards.glitch.me/) is a gallery of card designs created with javasript canvas. Updated every week in 2019, each card includes an editable code block where you can experiment with the code and tweak the design.

I wrote a [retrospective post]({% post_url 2019-12-32-making-canvas-cards. %}) about my experience working on the project.

I've often found that the best way to learn new skills is to have some practical application or outlet to work with. Canvas Cards has given me a good opportunity to stretch not only my javascript muscles, but also brought me back into the artistic side of coding and had me constantly on watch for inspiration.

The gallery is hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com), and all the source code is available [there](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/canvas-cards) and on [Github](https://github.com/lkpttn/deck).
