In 2021 Propel rebranded it’s flagship product, FreshEBT, to Providers - a singular destination for low income Americans to manage their finances. Accompanying new features and a visual refresh, I took the opportunity to establish Propel’s first design system, Citrus. Over the new few years I led the development of Citrus from a simple collection of components into a robust and flexible design system that powers the entire app.

This case study is available upon request.
