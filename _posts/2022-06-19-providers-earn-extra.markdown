I was the Design Lead for Propel’s Earn team, focused on putting “dollars in pockets” for low income Americans using Providers. Earn Extra is a feature that brought consumer surveys into the app, allowing users to earn money. The projects started with a small squad and simple prototype that blossomed into a major revenue and engagement driver for the app, placing millions of dollars in the pockets of low income Americans and increasing app sessions by 300% for survey takers.

During this time, I managed a team consisting of a researcher, visual designer, content designer and additional product designer.
